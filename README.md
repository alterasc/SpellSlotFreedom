# Spell Slot Freedom mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous

Allows using casting spells using higher-level slots without metamagic.

In Spellbook menu drag and drop spell that you want to cast at higher level to spell level switching panel on spell level where you need it.
To forget spell added that way to higher level drag and drop it to any lower level slot, that will erase it.
